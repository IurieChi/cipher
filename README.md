#cipher


# The cipher logic was (probably) invented and used by Gaius Julius Caesar and his troops during the Gallic Wars.
# The idea is rather simple â€“ every letter of the message is replaced by its nearest consequent, I have adde posibility to shift letters on user preferences.
# Moreover, let the code preserve the letters' case (lower-case letters will remain lower-case) and all non-alphabetical characters should remain untouched.
